# Fine-Tuning GPT-2 on the DailyDialog Dataset

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune OpenAI's GPT-2 language model on the [DailyDialog](https://huggingface.co/datasets/daily_dialog) dataset using Hugging Face Transformers in Google Colab.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Enhance GPT-2's ability to generate natural, conversational text resembling human dialogues.
- **Dataset:** [DailyDialog](https://huggingface.co/datasets/daily_dialog), containing high-quality multi-turn dialogues.

## Results

**Original GPT-2 Output:**

What do you think about these new discoveries that Dr. Sankara had suggested would lead to the end of human involvement in space exploration?” (The New Yorker, 20 June 2015) That was also when Karpovsky decided to tell us more. In 2006, he announced that “Science and the Universe — and the Universe in general” had reached the point where it could be used as a “scientific narrative.” He was writing that space exploration — from where we are today — has

**Fine-Tuned GPT-2 Output:**

What do you think about taking your English class again? Will students find it more effective? You can take this class, but you won’t necessarily enjoy your credit. You’ll only be able to take English classes. Maybe I’ll take classes like that. It’s hard, actually. I know there’s an English teacher and I want to try it on, but… Let’s discuss next Monday. Yeah, I’ll wait for it, we’ll get there at 20

**Analysis:**

- The fine-tuned model generates text that closely mimics human conversation, reflecting the style of the DailyDialog dataset.
- The original GPT-2 output is more abstract and less conversational.

## Conclusion

The project successfully fine-tuned GPT-2 to generate dialogue-like responses, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning on specific datasets to achieve desired language generation styles.
